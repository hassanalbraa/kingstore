/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for KING STORE.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and restricts write access to game offers to admins only.
 * Read access to game offers is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /game_offers/{gameOfferId}: Stores game offers.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges based on document existence.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are accessible only by the user themselves or an admin.
 * - Game offers are publicly readable, but only admins can create, update, or delete them.
 * - Admin status is determined by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 * - No user listing is allowed for the /users collection to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Admin status is managed via document existence in `/roles_admin/{userId}` to avoid needing to read user profile data for authorization.
